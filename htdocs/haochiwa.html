				<h4 class="secondpowercat">From Pogchampmaster (3.0):</h4>
				<p class="secondpowercat">There are a lot of things I like about this game. However, there's still a long way to go for this game to be a masterpiece. I suggest adding tutorials for each legend and adding a replay system for each match. That alone can drastically improve the game. I wish the best!!!</p>

				<h2 class="firstpowercat">How to play the game</h2>
					<p class="secondpowercat">Haochiwa is a 4v4 game that is combines elements of an FPS and a MOBA. The objective of the game is to conquer more area than your opponents.<p>
					<p class="secondpowercat">The game is divided into two halves, each of which is 10 minutes long. The teams switch sides after the first half ends.<p>
					<p class="secondpowercat">At the end of each half, the area conquered is measured by drawing a polygon for each team. An example is shown below:</p>
					<span class="secondpowercat"><img src="../images/haochiwa example.png" alt="Example of Area Calculation for HaoChiwa" width="35%"></span>
					<p class="secondpowercat">The score is computed in percentages. Here's the basis of the score:</p>
					<ul class="secondpowercat">
						<li>Area not conquered rewards nothing to either team.</li>
						<li>Area conquered entirely by a team is rewarded to that team.</li>
						<li>Area conquered by both teams is split 50-50.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="secondpowercat">The area is based on the top-down view. So, if two parts of the map overlap (with one part on top of the other), and both teams conquer either part (one team on the higher part, the other on the lower part), then that section of the map is considered "conquered by both teams".</p>
					<p class="secondpowercat">At the end of the game, the scores on each half are averaged. The team with the higher score wins.</p>
					<p class="secondpowercat">In case of a tie, the game normally just declares it as a draw. However, overtime can be activated for custom games.</p>
