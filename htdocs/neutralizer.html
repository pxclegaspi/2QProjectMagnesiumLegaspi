				<p class="secondpowercat">There are a lot of things I like about this game. However, there's still a long way to go for this game to be a masterpiece. I suggest adding tutorials for each game mode and adding a replay system for each match. That alone can drastically improve the game. I wish the best!!!</p>

			<h2 class="firstpowercat">The Game in a Nutshell</h2>
				<p class="secondpowercat">Neutralizer is a card game involving numbers and symbols. It is available on app stores and real-life stores.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">The objective of the game is to get rid of all your cards by making equations using the number cards and symbol cards.</p>
		</section>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<section>
			<h2 class="firstpowercat">In Depth Rules</h2>
				<h3 class="secondpowercat">Part 1: Setting up</h3>
				<p class="secondpowercat">There are 70 number cards, 42 symbol cards, and 10 equal sign cards, making a total of 122 cards.</p>
				<span class="secondpowercat"><img src="../images/neutralizer cards.png" alt="All the possible Neutralizer Cards" title="All the possible Neutralizer cards." width="30%"></span>
				<p class="secondpowercat">Each of the different kinds of cards are on a separate sub-deck when bought physically. On digital versions of Neutralizer, the game automatically knows to separate the three sub-decks on every match.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">Separate the three sub-decks. Shuffle each sub-deck, then distribute accordingly to the players. Each player gets 3 number cards and 2 symbol cards at the start, making a total of 5 cards each.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">Although there is no limit to how many players can play at the same time, it is recommended to only play with up to 4 players a time. This is to increase chances of the game running smoothly for the whole match.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">Choose the turn order. In offical tournaments, the turn order is randomized, then the players sit accordingly so that turns go clockwise.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h3 class="secondpowercat">Part 2: The Core Game</h3>
				<p class="secondpowercat">On each turn, create an equation using the cards you have. Once you're done, place them in front of you for the others to see. If no one questions the equation you placed, you may put them in the "DISCARD" pile.</p>
				<span class="secondpowercat"><img src="../images/neutralizer ex 1.png" alt="Example of placing an equation" title="Example of placing an equation" width="30%"></span>
				<p class="secondpowercat">In the example above, the player has number cards 1, 2, and 3, and symbol cards + and ^ (exponent). They placed the equation "1+2=3" for the others to get a chance to question it. Since it's a true equation, they are allowed to put it in the "DISCARD" pile. </p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">If an equation placed seems suspicious, you may challenge it. If the equation is false, the person who played it should put it back in their hand, and they must draw 2 number cards and 1 symbol card. If the equation is true, you must draw 3 number cards and 2 symbol cards.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">If you can't (or don't want to) form an equation with the cards in your hand, you may draw 1 number card and 1 symbol card. In official tournaments, if you still can't (or don't want to ) form an equation after drawing cards, you must skip your turn. However, in casual matches, you may opt to keep drawing cards (1 number card and 1 symbol card for each draw) until you play an equation you're happy with.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">The first person to discard all of the cards in their hand wins! However, depending on the agreed-upon rules, there are multiple ways to identify the 2nd placers and below, which we will discuss in the 3rd part of the In-Depth Rules.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h3 class="secondpowercat">Part 3: Determining the Winner and the Runners-up</h3>
				<p class="secondpowercat">The first way to determine the end results is to just declare who's the winner and ignore the runners-up. While this may be favorable for casual games on the go, this is not good for serious players. Here's the perception of the end results for this method:</p>
				<ul class="secondpowercat">
					<li>Winner: Declared as the winner!</li>
					<li>Runners-up: All equal losers, regardless of closeness to winning.</li>
					<li>Quickness of Method: very fast</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="secondpowercat">The second way of determining the end results is for the remaining players to continue playing until there's only one left with cards. This is a more accurate way of determining the end results, but it makes games very long, which may not be good for players who just want to play more games. Here's the perception of the end results for this method:</p>
				<ul class="secondpowercat">
					<li>Winner: Declared as the winner!</li>
					<li>Runners-up: Determined by who discards all their cards first.</li>
					<li>Quickness of Method: very slow (dependent on the number of players)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="secondpowercat">The third way of determining the end results is to calculate the score of each player based on the cards they have. Each of the runners-up add up the scores of each card they have. Then, they negate it to determine their score for that match. The winner has a score of 0, since they have no cards left.</p>
				<p class="secondpowercat">Here's the score for each card:</p>
				<ul class="secondpowercat">
					<li>Number Cards = face value</li>
					<li>Symbol Cards = 5 points each</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="secondpowercat">This is favorable for most offical tournaments, where a method of determining end results reliably and quickly is desired. Here's the perception of the end results for this method:</p>
				<ul class="secondpowercat">
					<li>Winner: Declared as a winner, with 0 points.</li>
					<li>Runners-up: Determined by the negative of the sum of their cards' scores, with higher score being better.</li>
					<li>Quickness of Method: fast</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 class="firstpowercat">Fun Fact about this Game</h2>
				<p class="secondpowercat">This game is inspired by the board game named Equalizer. Briar Amari Breckinridge combined elements of Equalizer with the famous card game Uno to make Neutralizer.</p>
