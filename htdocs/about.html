			<h2>Here's the story of Variance Games and its founders.</h2>
		
			<p class="about">Variance Games was founded in 2025 by <b>Samuel Zurg Trikoko</b>, <b>Nilam Lan Arendse</b>, <b>Takondwa Shae Andela</b>, <b>Oluwayemisi Jools Hext</b>, <b>Alinafe Oluwayemisi Zhang</b>, <b>Fumnanya Oluwayemisi Taggart</b>, and <b>Briar Amari Breckinridge</b>. Although Trikoko was the leader, he wasn't good at programming. His forte was creating and sketching ideas.<p>
			
			<p class="about">The first few years were rough for Variance Games. They weren't able to convince investors, and their crowdsourcing attempts had too little yield. So, they had to be even more frugal than they already were, and their debt from banks were so high that they thought it was futile to continue.</p>
			
			<p class="about">Despite all these setbacks, they persevered, and fortunately, in 2032, their works paid off. They had finished their first game called HaoChiwa. At first, there were mixed reactions from video game players. Some said that it was a bold move to combine two popular genres. Others said it will be doomed to fail. Fortunately for HaoChiwa's playerbase, Variance Games listened to their concerns, and in 2035, a decade after the founding of the company, HaoChiwa was able to have a stable playerbase, and a year-long tournament for the game was made, which was named HaoChiwa Global Reach.</p>
			
			<p class="about">In 2039, Arendse had an idea for another game. She called it Gathunt. It is a battle royale game with mechanics from Minecraft, an all-time favorite that survived the test of time. Creating Gathunt was going to be a bigger challenge than HaoChiwa, as that would require collaborating with Mojang and Microsoft, two giants in their respective fields.</p>
			
			<p class="about">Things would prove even more challenging when Arendse told her idea to the other founders, as they were divided on whether this was a good idea or not. On one side, they claim that diversifying would be very beneficial for the company. On the other, they claim that if Gathunt would fail, it would taint the reputation of the domoany, driving away some of HaoChiwa's playerbase.</p>
			
			<p class="about">Finally in 2040, the founders unanimously agreed to make Gathunt, on the condition that they should be very careful in making it. They seeked out the higher-ups of Mojang, the company that made Minecraft, and Microsoft, the company that bought Mojang. The deal was that Mojang and Microsoft will be the ones making Gathunt (as it would have very similar gameplay to Minecraft) and maintaining it, while Variance Games will take care of the infrastructure (e.g. servers, LAN venues, etc.) and marketing. A 60-40 deal for the profits, in favor of Mojang and Microsoft, was proposed by Andela, but after some discussion, all parties agreed with a 65-35 deal (with Mojang and Microsoft taking the bigger share).</p>
			
			<p class="about">In 2041, while making Gathunt, Breckinridge was in his desk at home when he got another idea for Variance Games's third game. It was to be a card game called Neutralizer. Due to Breckinridge's passion for mathematics, and his advocacy for diversity in Variance Games's games, he was to make both paper and digital copies of the game.<p>
			
			<p class="about">A few weeks before 2042, Gathunt enters beta-testing. Through constructive feedback, developers quickly improved the game to be ready for its 2042 release.
			
			<p class="about">The current year is 2043. Neutralizer just finished beta testing, and it's now ready to be officially launched in a few days. Variance Games is enjoying success like never before, and people all around the world are enjoying the games. Despite this, however, it's inevitable that this company will encounter more big challenges along the way. The founders are hoping that they will be able to get through said challenges once they come.</p>
